# Editable Tree Model with Drag and Drop

This is a version of the Qt 5.15.3 example [Editable Tree Model](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-itemviews-editabletreemodel-example.html)
modified to allow drag and drop, according to instructions in [Qt's documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/model-view-programming.html#using-model-view-classes).
It is currently *not* working.
